# TCP & UDP Simulator
Java application to simulate tcp and udp connections.
User choose mode (tcp or udp), port for the server so the clients could connect to, number of server threads to response to the connecting clients and number of clients.
Every client sends two random integers (user specifies their maximum) and the server should response with the sum of those integers to the client.
